# Preliminary-online-interview-for-python-developer
A task given to complete for a python developer role

***NB:***
This document contains answers to the task assigned to me. 
All answers are as a result of my code output. 
It is necessary for me to point out that the the only variable type contained in the data given is nominal. As such, computing the mean, standard deviation or variance for the dataset is not a good idea.
This is because the data is not quantitative. However, I have used the frequency distribution wherever possible to get an estimate.

## Answers to the Questions
1.	The Mean of the colours: 7.916667
2.	The colour mostly worn (mode) throughout the week: BLUE
3.	The Median colour is: GREEN
4.	The variance colour is: Cannot be calculated (data is not numeric)
5.	Probability of a RED shirt chosen at random: 0.09473684210526316
6.	Check the source code for answer
7.	Check the source code for answer
8.	Check the source code for answer
9.	The sum of 50 Fibonacci sequence: code works faster for fib(20) but very slow to generate sum of fib (50)

# Limitations
1. The Data is a norminal data, however questions relating to quantitative data were asked
2. The run time for Recursive sum of 50 Fibonacci sequence is extremely slow
